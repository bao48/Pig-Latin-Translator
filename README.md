# Pig-Latin-Translator

##### Fun little thing without any pratical use.
##### Rules are detailed on the Wikipedia page [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin).
##### Meant to conceal most of the pig's brainwork translating for the background so the code is all in the Pigs class with the only method that the user is able to call is translate().

##### Will turn stuff like 
> *happy thanksgiving! did the lazy dog jump over the orange string yet?* 
##### into 
>*appyhay anksgivingthay! idday ethay azylay ogday umpjay overway ethay orangeway instray etyay?*
